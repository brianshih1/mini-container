# Future Work

There are a lot of container features I would love to explore in the future, such as:

- **networking**: I would love to learn how systems like Docker enable containers to communicate with each other and outside the world.
- **image layers**: I would love to learn how Docker images work under the hood and how the Docker engine's cache ensures the efficient creation of Docker images.
- **hacking a container**: I would love to learn how to attack a container to understand container guarantees better.
